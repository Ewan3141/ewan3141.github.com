    <td>During the lesson I learned what things like and google sheets use in order to make spreadsheets that calculate certain values for you, making things like finances a lot easier to work out and work with. Strategies that were effective were all the ones I had to employ in previous lessons such as noting down specific information and listening carefully to what the teacher says.</td>

    <td>A habit that I need to learn is not messing around in class so much, something that is not normally that big of a problem, this lesson though i was talking and mucking around with my chair more than I would have done normally. That messing around with my chair also limited my learning because I could not pay attention to all of what was being said.</td>

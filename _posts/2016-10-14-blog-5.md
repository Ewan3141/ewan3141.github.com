(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>Yes, I added nested ifs and vlookup commands.</td>

    <td>Over the course of the lesson I learned how to use nested if formulas and how to search for a certain sentence or word in a variety of shells. A nested if is a formula that has an if formula that has more than one if inside it allowing for more than one criteria.</td>

    <td>I had not completed my homework to a sufficient standard so I had to redo part of it in the lesson whilst learning some of the things that I should have done for homework such as vlookup and nested ifs. </td>

    <td>Next time I would listen and write down what I was doing for homework so I do not allow myself to stray from the task and use a different formula to achieve the same outcome.</td>

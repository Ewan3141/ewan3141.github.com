    <td>I learned through using different websites to try and get different words into lists, and I used these websites to learn how to assign new values to lists so I could expand my AIs vocabulary.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time I donâ€™t feel I shall change much, as for the most part, work inside of the lesson as well as outside of it were very successful, I ended the lesson with a basic piece of code that code expand its own vocabulary, and after working on it at home I made it able to identify different adverbs as positive or negative.</td>

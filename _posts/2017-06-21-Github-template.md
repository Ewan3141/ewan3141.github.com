    <th>Target for this lesson?</th>
    <td>To have written a piece of code that tells a user its opinion on something and then uses their response to expand its own vocabulary, to learn what is a good thing and a bad thing.</td>

    <th>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</th>

  <tr>
    <td>I learned through using different websites to try and get different words into lists, and I used these websites to learn how to assign new values to lists so I could expand my AIs vocabulary.</td>

  <tr>
    <th>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The thing that mostly limited my learning was the different ways in which I could code my work, for example I couldn't find ways of making it pick from different lists depending on certain situations.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I donâ€™t feel I shall change much, as for the most part, work inside of the lesson as well as outside of it were very successful, I ended the lesson with a basic piece of code that code expand its own vocabulary, and after working on it at home I made it able to identify different adverbs as positive or negative.</td>
